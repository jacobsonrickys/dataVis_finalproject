#<a name="model"></a>**Data Model**

![Our original data model was rather messy, as we had ~20 tables as well as the US Census Data.](./Model1.png)

![After an extensive process of cleaning data, this is the resulting data model.](./Model2.png)



#<a name="clean"></a>**Data Cleaning** 
We initially had 20 tables to clean - so for simplicity's sake we will just show an example of how we cleaned a few of these twenty. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
daycare	=	read_csv("/Users/amandale/Downloads/stcyngyn-fall-2017-edvproject-5/day_care_centers.csv", col_types = cols(
  place_id = col_character(),
  zipcode = col_integer(),
  place_type = col_character(),
  place_name = col_character(),
  latitude = col_double(),
  longitude = col_double(),
  website_url = col_character(),
  property_address = col_character(),
  map_url = col_character(),
  phone = col_character(),
  opening_hours = col_character()
))

daycare = daycare %>% dplyr::select(place_id, zipcode, place_type, place_name, latitude, longitude, opening_hours)

for(n in names(daycare)){
  daycare[n] <- data.frame(lapply(daycare[n], gsub, pattern="[^ -~]",replacement = ""))
}

write_csv(daycare, "/Users/amandale/Downloads/DataCleaning/daycarecenters.csv")

```

We also have a slew of tables that should be combined into one. This also involved changing the column names as well as creating a new column. The code we used to do this is below: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
driver_serv = dplyr::mutate(driver_serv, place = "driver service")
esl = dplyr::mutate(esl, place = "esl")
grocery = dplyr::mutate(grocery, place = "grocery store")
markets = dplyr::mutate(markets, place = "market")

names(markets)[3] = "place_type"
names(markets)[4] = "place_name"

pcp = dplyr::mutate(pcp, place = "primary care location")
supermarkets = dplyr::mutate(supermarkets, place = "supermarket")
worship = dplyr::mutate(worship, place = "place of worship")
places = rbind(driver_serv, esl)
places = rbind(places, grocery)
places = rbind(places, markets)
places = rbind(places, pcp)
places = rbind(places, supermarkets)
places = rbind(places, worship)
```

## Types of Resources
This cross-tab lists the types of resources within each zipcodes. There is no doubt that coming into a foreign place with little understanding of a culture is difficult, and the zipcodes that are most rich in resources can mean that refugees have just a slightly easier time getting settled, especially when it comes to local government offices to register their identities, grocery stores for sustenance, and places of worship, where they may find people coming from similar circumstances, and build connections, and communities of people who support each other while adjusting.

## Types of Schools{.tabset .tabset-fade}
It would have been interesting to see what the enrollment is for refugee students in either charter or public schools to compare, but that data is not made available. Because this is a refugee relocation data set, it might be safe to assume that the schools in the data have refugee students enrolled, so we will assume more public schools have refugee students than charter school. 


### Charter Schools

The fact that charter schools are even in the data may be a hopeful sign that some refugee parents are fortunate enough to send their children to charter schools.

### Public Schools

We do not have any data for private schools in this table; considering refugee's circumstances, they may lack resources to pay tuition for private schools.

 

#<a name="apts"></a>**Schools and Apartments**
## How many schools are in range of how many apartments?
Adjusting the slider below changes the range. If we set the slider to it's minimum value, we see that all apartments in the data set are within 1 km from a public elementary school. This means that the local municipalities did a good job of ensuring public education for their constituents.

Increasing the range causes the data to take a Boltzmann-like distribution, which means that the majority of apartments are near only a handful of schools, and the number of outliers decrease as you progress rightward on the graph. 

```{r}
R = 6371
deg2rad <- function(deg) {(deg * pi) / (180)}
# Determines the curvilinear distance between two coordinates in km
distances <- schools %>% dplyr::mutate(dLat = deg2rad(slat-alat), dLon = deg2rad(slong-along), a = sin(dLat/2)*sin(dLat/2)+cos(deg2rad(slat))*cos(deg2rad(alat))*sin(dLon/2)*sin(dLon/2), c = 2*atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a)), dist = R*c) %>% dplyr::select(school_name,apartment_name,dist)

<!-- The less rent costs, the bigger the percentage it takes from a family's, or one refugee's income, which Amanda has mentioned in a previous insight was odd.

#<a name="race"></a>**Homeowner Demographics**
The chart below tracks the time it takes to get from an apartment to the nearest market and school graphed against the percentage of the population that is white. Since Atlanta is in the South, historical racial segregation would lead to the assumption that conditions would worsen as communities become less white. This would theoretically manifest itself as longer travel times to get to school and the market. The chart below, however, tells a very different story.
```{r}
times <- times %>% dplyr::filter(is.element(zipcode, zipcodes)) %>% dplyr::mutate(market_time = dplyr::if_else(grepl("hour",mtime), 60*as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(mtime," "))[1])+as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(mtime," "))[3]),as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(mtime," "))[1])), school_time = dplyr::if_else(grepl("hour",stime), 60*as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(stime," "))[1])+as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(stime," "))[3]),as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(stime," "))[1]))) %>% dplyr::select(-mtime,-stime,-zipcode)

renderPlot({
  times %>% dplyr::filter(market_time<150,school_time<150)%>% tidyr::gather(variable, value, -white_homeowners) %>% dplyr::mutate(label = dplyr::if_else(variable == "market_time", "Home to Market", "Home to School")) %>%  ggplot(aes(x = white_homeowners, y = value, color = label)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Proportion of White Homeowners", y = "Travel Times (min)")
})
```
It would appear that the proportion of homeowners who are white has no effect on the travel time to schools nor the travel time to markets. Furthermore, the travel time to school seems uniform across the board. While the data alone gives no indication for cause, it is possible that this uniform travel time to school is the result of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which forced the integration of de jure segregated schools in the South.

It also appears that the travel time to markets is polarized amongst two different extremes. In one case, the travel time is in the single digits; in the other, it's well over an hour. Unfortunately, the data alone is not sufficient to determine the cause.

#<a name="rent"></a>**Rent Statistics**
## Rent and Retail comparisons
One can see both views and compare them side by side. Here is are the rent and retail histograms side by side. You can see that the histogram for retail varies a lot more than the histogram for rent.

```{r}

renderPlot({
  units %>% ggplot(aes(rent)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "blue")
})

renderPlot({
  units %>% ggplot(aes(retail)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, color = "red")
})

```

## Rent and Jobs by Apartment 
Here's graph to compare the rent and jobs for each apartment complex. Interestingly most of the rent is below 2,000 which is pretty standard rent, but the number of jobs varies greatly. Filtered out outliers with jobs in the billions but I think it would be interesting to look more into the outliers like creekside crossing with 131 billion jobs
```{r}
q <- ggplot(units, aes(x=place_id))
q <- q + geom_point(aes(y = jobs, colour = "Jobs"))
  
  q <- q + geom_point(aes(y = rent, colour = "Rent"))
  q <- q + scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*5, name = "Average Rent"))
  q <- q + scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
  q <- q + labs(y = "Average Jobs",
                x = "Apartments",
                colour = "Parameter")
  q <- q + theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9))
q


#p <- ggplot(units, aes(x=place_id))
#p <- p + geom_point(aes(y = jobs, colour = "Jobs"))
  
#  p <- p + geom_point(aes(y = rent, colour = "Rent"))
#  p <- p + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,10000))
#  p <- p + scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
#  p <- p + labs(y = "Average Jobs",
#                x = "Apartments",
#                colour = "Parameter")
#  p <- p + theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.9))
#p
```

## Rent brackets
Separates high (above 3k) , medium (1-3k ), and low rent (<1k) 
```{r}
lowrent <- units %>% dplyr::filter(rent<=1000) %>% dplyr::select(rent,place_id) %>% tbl_df()
medrent <- units %>% dplyr::filter(rent>=1000 && rent<=3000) %>% dplyr::select(rent,place_id) %>% tbl_df()
highrent <- units %>% dplyr::filter(rent>=3000) %>% dplyr::select(rent,place_id) %>% tbl_df()

renderPlot({
  lowrent %>% ggplot(aes(y = rent, x = place_id)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "blue")
})

renderPlot({
  medrent %>% ggplot(aes(y = rent, x = place_id)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "red")
})

renderPlot({
  highrent %>% ggplot(aes(y = rent, x = place_id)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "green")
  
})
```
There's definitely a lot more apartments with lower rents than higher. Retail is showed on the color scale. Interestingly the retail numbers seem to vary throughout each of the rent brackets though. 
We're able to isolate the outliers in the data we can see four apartments: the berkshire terminis, indigo house, villas on briarcliff, and trace atlanta have extremely high rents. It would be interesting to look at these apartment and see why their rent is so much more expensive and why refugees are choosing these apartments.

#<a name="rfg"></a>**Ideal Housing**
First I created a series of boxplots to visualize multiple variables on our "ideal zipcode" subset discovered [here](https://data.world/rc38246/f-17-edv-project-5/insights?anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.data.world%2FyLLFqp4RQGq5XUjes1Op_image.png&id=df0e03e7-38da-4bf1-9deb-ed10e35771d9&source=sb).
```{r, warning = FALSE}

plot1 = ggplot(data = zcta, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=median_rent)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Rent Dist")

plot2 = ggplot(data = zcta, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=rent_percentage_of_income)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Rent %")

plot3 = ggplot(data = zcta, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=housing_units)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Units")

zcta2 = zcta %>% dplyr::mutate(accessible_housing = housing_units/median_rent)

plot4 = ggplot(data = zcta2, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=accessible_housing)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Acc. Housing")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol=4) 

```
The most important to notice is the "accessible housing" score. This is a calculated field, where "accessible housing" = "housing units" / "median rent". We will use this later in evalutating ideal zipcodes for refugees to reside in. Ideally, we would like an "accessible housing" score of at least 15. 

Next we look at how many units are available per zipcode: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = zcta, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=housing_units)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("Housing Units Available by Zip") + scale_x_discrete()
```

At first glance, as the rent percentage increases, median rent decreases. Does this intuitively make sense?
```{r}
ggplot(data = zcta, mapping = aes(x=rent_percentage_of_income, y=median_rent)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, fullrange= TRUE, se=FALSE, color = "black" ) + ggtitle("Rent Analytics ") 
```

Answer: Not really. We then created a parameter called "housing_fence", as we are primarily interested in zipcodes with plenty of housing. In this example, our "housing_fence" is 5000. 
```{r}
zcta3 = zcta %>% dplyr::mutate(housing_plentiful = ifelse(housing_units < 5000, "false", "true"))
ggplot(data = zcta3, mapping = aes(x=rent_percentage_of_income, y=median_rent, color = housing_plentiful)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, fullrange= TRUE, se=FALSE ) + ggtitle("Rent Analytics 2")
```
We can see that rent goes down when there is plenty of housing - which makes a lot more sense.

Experiment below with changing the "housing fence," and how it affects trend lines in segregated groups. 

```{r}
housing_min = min(zcta$housing_units)
housing_max = max(zcta$housing_units)


sliderInput("varFence", "Housing Fence:", min = housing_min, max = housing_max, value = 5)

renderPlot({
  zcta %>% dplyr::mutate(housing_plentiful = ifelse(housing_units < input$varFence, "false", "true")) %>% ggplot( mapping = aes(x=rent_percentage_of_income, y=median_rent, color = housing_plentiful)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, fullrange= TRUE, se=FALSE ) + ggtitle("Rent Analytics 3")
})
```

We then take the top 10 zipcodes of this subset by the availability of housing units. I wanted to look at the racial makeup of these areas - the reasoning being that greater diversity results in an easier acclimation into the community for refugees. 
```{r}
zcta4 = zcta %>% dplyr::arrange(desc(housing_units)) %>% dplyr::top_n(10, housing_units) %>% dplyr::mutate(minority_perc = 1 - white_homeowners)
ggplot(data = zcta4, mapping = aes(x=zcta, y=minority_perc)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+ggtitle("% of Minority Homeowners by Zipcode") + scale_x_discrete()
```

When we take zipcodes with greater than 25% minorities, we get the following zipcodes:
```{r}
zcta5 = zcta4 %>% dplyr::filter(minority_perc > .25)
zcta5$zcta
```

Lastly, we will look at the variety of places available in these four zipcodes: 
```{r, warning = FALSE}
places3 = places2 %>% dplyr::filter(is.element(zipcode, zcta5$zcta)) %>% select(zipcode, place_type) %>% dplyr::group_by(zipcode, place_type) %>% summarise(num_place= n())

places4 = dcast(data = places3, formula(zipcode~place_type, value.var = num_place, fun.aggregate = sum))
places4 = melt(data=places4, id.vars='zipcode')
ggplot(data = places4, aes( x = factor( zipcode ), y = value, fill = variable ) ) + geom_bar( stat = 'identity' ) + ggtitle("Variety of Resources by Zip")
```

You can also look at the boxplot for each of these zipcodes: 
```{r}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("varZip", label = "Select ZipCode:",
              choices = places3$zipcode, selected = '30024', multiple=FALSE)
)

renderPlot({
  dataFilter = places3 %>% dplyr::filter(zipcode == input$varZip)
  ggplot(data=dataFilter, mapping=aes(x=zipcode, y=num_place)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_x_discrete() + ggtitle("Spread of Resources by Zip")

})
```

Through the bargraph and boxplots, it's easy to see zipcode '30024' is the most promising to house refugees.

As confirmation - there are resources for many immigrants that can be found on the internet in the '30024' zipcode. Example [here](http://www.aarc-atlanta.org/).
